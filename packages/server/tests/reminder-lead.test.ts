 * was changed: a clinic that shortened 48h to 24h kept getting yesterday's
 * schedule for everything already on the books, with nothing on the pane saying
 * so. `settings.update` now moves the pending reminders with the setting.
 *
 * What is bounded is which reminders move. Only the ones the pending list is
 * made of — still pending, on an appointment still booked — and only where the
 * appointment is still ahead. A message that was owed at the old lead and has
 * been sent, skipped, or simply missed is history, and a lead time is not a way
 * to rewrite it.
