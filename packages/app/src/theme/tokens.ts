// Lustre design tokens — the single source of truth for the app's visual system,
// resolving the two design systems (Component Inventory §7.1). Components
// consume these through `StyleSheet.create`; nothing writes a raw hex, size or
// family.
//
// Invariants: `accent` never means "good", "paid" or "settled" and is not the
// primary button fill (the designs draw those in `ink`); semantic colours are
// status only, never interactive; `danger` is never used for money. `space` is
// keyed by 4px steps (`space[3]` is 12) and measured odd sizes snap to the
// grid. React Native selects a face by family name and never synthesises a
// weight, so always set `fontFamily`, never `fontWeight`; DM Mono ships 400 and
// 500 only, and heavier weights round down to 500. Letter-spacing is in px —
// React Native has no em. Android has historically flattened multi-layer
// `boxShadow` to a single elevation, so check `fab` on a physical device.
