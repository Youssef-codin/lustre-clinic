/**
 * The one signal that says everything read so far came from a database that is
 * no longer there.
 *
 * Demo mode swaps the transport underneath a shared cache. The query keys name
 * the procedure and its input, never which server answered, and `queryClient`
 * holds a day of them (`queryClient.ts`) — so a demo entered on a phone that
 * has been reading the real clinic paints real patients until each demo
 * request lands, and leaving the demo paints invented ones. Neither is a thing
 * to show a secretary, and the reseed behind "Reset demo data" has the same
 * shape: the rows the screens are holding no longer exist.
 *
 * This module imports nothing. It sits below `queryClient`, which reaches
 * `connection` and so back to `demo/flag`, and a cycle through that chain is
 * what the indirection is here to avoid — `client.ts` does the clearing,
 * `demo/flag.ts` and `demo/index.ts` only report the moment.
 *
 * `screens/day` runs a query layer of its own (`data/hooks.ts`) that the cache
 * knows nothing about, which is why this is a generation others can subscribe
 * to rather than a call to `queryClient.clear()` on its own.
