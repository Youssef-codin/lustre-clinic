/**
 * Local mode's file: the whole clinic as one JSON document in the app's own
 * storage. Not AsyncStorage, which Android caps at a few megabytes and cannot
 * read a single value much past two — a few years of a clinic outgrows both.
 *
 * Writing is synchronous and goes to a second file first, which is then moved
 * over the first. A write cut off part way leaves the last good copy behind,
 * and the copy moved over it is complete, so a read tries the main file and
 * falls back to the next one.
 *
 * Nothing else has a copy, so the clinic leaves the phone the one way it can
 * without a server: the same file, handed to Android's share sheet, which
 * reaches Drive, WhatsApp, email and Files without this app holding anyone's
 * Google sign-in. A file brought back in is the same format again.
