/**
 * The terminating tRPC link that answers out of `./handlers` instead of over
 * HTTP.
 *
 * Two things make what comes out of here the same shape as what comes out of
 * the clinic server, which is the whole point of doing it at this level rather
 * than stubbing each screen's data layer:
 *
 * - **The wire's types, not the handlers'.** The handlers deal in `Date`,
 *   because the services they mirror do. There is no transformer on either side
 *   (`api/types.ts`), so a `timestamptz` reaches the app as the ISO string JSON
 *   made of it, and every screen already parses one. `toWire` is that JSON
 *   round trip, so demo mode cannot be the one place a date arrives as an
 *   object.
 * - **The client's error contract.** A failure comes back as a
 *   `TRPCClientError` carrying `data.appCode`, which is what `errors.ts`
 *   classifies and what every screen localizes from. A demo that threw plain
 *   `Error`s would take every refusal — a double booking, a payment over the
 *   balance — to the generic failure message.
 *
 * The delay is deliberate. The screens have pending states written for a round
 * trip over Tailscale, and answering in under a millisecond does not exercise
 * them: buttons never show their spinner, and optimistic updates land before
 * anyone sees the transition. This is a fifth of the realistic worst case,
 * which is enough for those states to read as intended without the demo feeling
 * slow.
 *
 * Local mode answers through the same handlers, as a real clinic: no delay, and
 * a write is on file before it is answered (`./local`). One that cannot be
 * written is refused, and the rows go back to what the file holds, so nothing
 * is shown as saved that was not.
