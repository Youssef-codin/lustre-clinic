/**
 * `server/src/modules/migration/migration.service.ts` — what a patient who
 * predates the cutoff brings with them, written by `patient.create` when the
 * **Old patient** switch is on. There is no `enter` procedure any more: two
 * ways to register an old patient is how one of them ends up allocating a fresh
 * number to somebody who already has one.
 *
 * A balance is derived and never stored, so debt carried over from before the
 * cutoff has nowhere of its own to live: it is given a synthetic appointment
 * and visit, dated at the cutoff, charged with what is owed and carrying no
 * procedures. `isOpeningBalance` is how the readers tell it apart. It is
 * `done` rather than `booked` — `done` holds no slot, so any number of them at
 * the same instant do not collide.
