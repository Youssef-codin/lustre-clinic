// The money cluster's own money renderer. `components/domain/MoneyValue` has
// landed and this is deliberately not it — yet. The two agree on every rule
// that decides a figure (piastres in, whole pounds out, Latin numerals, `ج.م`
// trailing in Arabic) and disagree on everything the money designs need from
// the props: `currencyVariant`, `currencySuffix`, `currencyStyle` and `weight`,
// none of which the shared one carries, and a figure face — the shared one
// pins DM Mono per §7.11, these screens are drawn in Instrument Sans. Folding
// them together means widening the shared component and re-deciding the face
// for the day view and the patient rows at the same time, which is a call for
// whoever owns `components/domain`, not a side effect of wiring up the server.
//
// This is the only place the cluster turns an amount into text; the arithmetic
// lives in `money.ts`, which has no React Native import and is testable. The figure and
// the currency are separate Texts, and both take Instrument Sans: §7.11 put
// money in DM Mono for tabular alignment, but the money designs set every
// figure in the sans face and that is what these screens are held against, so
// the mono is opt-in through `face` rather than the default. `ج.م` has no mono
// coverage either way. Child order is locale-driven and the row is a plain `row`, never
// `row-reverse`: Yoga mirrors `row` under RTL and un-mirrors `row-reverse`, so
// a plain row makes one child order correct in both directions. The
// screen-reader label is always the full figure, never the compact one.
