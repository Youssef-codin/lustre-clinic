/**
 * Every call the money cluster makes, over the real tRPC client. This replaced
 * `_LocalMoneyApi.ts`, an in-memory store behind TanStack-Query-shaped hooks —
 * a payment recorded against it updated the screen and was gone on reload.
 *
 * The hooks keep that module's names and return shape, so the screens changed
 * their import and little else. Two things they no longer carry:
 *
 * - **No `version`.** The stub had no cache, so a payment three panes deep
 *   bumped a counter every query re-keyed on. There is a real cache now, and
 *   `recordPayment` invalidates `balance` and `visit` on success. Keeping a
 *   hand-rolled cache key beside a query cache is how you end up reconciling
 *   two of them.
 * - **No latency switch.** `setStubFailing` existed to make the failure states
 *   visible; a server that is off does that now.
 *
 * `error` is an `ERROR_CODE`, never a message: the client localizes from the
 * code and never parses what the server said (§4, §14). `isLoading` is
 * `isPending` — no data yet, which is the question a skeleton is asking.
