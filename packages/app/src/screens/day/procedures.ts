/**
 * What is going to be done, as the booking holds it before anything is written.
 * A visit's procedures are lines with a tooth and a price (§5, §9), and a
 * booking is a plan for exactly those lines — so the draft is shaped like them,
 * and `bookedProcedures` hands the whole list to the appointment, which carries
 * one of its own (it once carried a single `typeId`, and the rest of the plan
 * had to ride along in the note).
 *
 * Grouping is by tooth, not by procedure, because that is how the work is
 * spoken about at the desk and in the chair: "UL6 needs a filling and a
 * cleaning" is one tooth with two lines, and a flat list makes the reader
 * gather them. Lines with no tooth are one group and always sort last — a
 * scaling belongs to the mouth, not to a number.
 *
 * Money is integer piastres end to end (§7.12); nothing here formats it.
