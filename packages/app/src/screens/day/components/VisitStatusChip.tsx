 * painted the same words grey, so the colour changed as you moved between them.
 * One state, one colour, wherever it is read.
 *
 * Green is the mock's `.chip`, grey its `.chip.is-open`, and the split is
 * settled against still open — a visit that is over is history, and everything
 * else is work in hand. Only the chair pulses (`pulse-dot`): the visit is
 * running and the dot says so without a word. Reduced motion leaves it lit
