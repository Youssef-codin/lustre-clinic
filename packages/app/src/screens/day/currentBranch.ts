/**
 * The branch the desk is working from: the day view's branch picker, shared
 * with the patient record's WhatsApp button so a message goes out from the
 * branch on screen. A pick holds for the day it was made on and no longer —
 * the next day, and on every launch, it goes back to the branch the schedule
 * has open. The process can outlive a day (the listener service keeps it up),
 * so the pick is dated rather than trusted to be forgotten.
