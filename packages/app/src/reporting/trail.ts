/**
 * The tap trail (SPEC §17): what the app did just before a report, as
 * breadcrumbs. The SDK keeps the last hundred and attaches them to whatever is
 * sent next, so a glitch that did not crash still arrives with its taps when
 * somebody presses "Report a problem".
 *
 * This file does not import the SDK. `api/` and `navigation/` leave crumbs from
 * here, and `bun test` reaches both, so the SDK is plugged in as a sink by
 * `reporting.ts` when reports are on. With no sink a crumb goes nowhere.
 *
 * Every crumb is built from values the app chose (a route name, a procedure
 * path, a status), and `privacy.ts` still checks each one on the way out.
