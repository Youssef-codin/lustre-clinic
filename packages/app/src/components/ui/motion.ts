/**
 * Theme is values-only and holds no motion, so the curves live with the
 * components that animate (Component Inventory §3.4); durations are ms. The
 * easings are the designs' own curves: sheet `.32,.72,0,1`, promote
 * `.22,.9,.3,1`, spring `.34,1.4,.5,1`. Every design ends with a
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` block; components read the RN signal via
 * `useReducedMotion` and fall through to duration 0 rather than skipping, so the
 * end state is always applied. `PULSE` is the 2s keyframe (1 → .35 → 1, 1000ms
 * per half).
