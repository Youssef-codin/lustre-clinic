/**
 * The app's global navigation: four items, 22px stroked icons over an 11px
 * label, the active tab in `ink` and the rest in `muted`. The bar sits in flow
 * at the bottom of the shell rather than absolutely positioned, and carries the
 * bottom safe-area inset itself — an absolute position would put the labels
 * under Android's own gesture bar.
 *
 * The fourth tab says the role — "Doctor" or "Secretary", over a stethoscope or
 * a headset — because the device is the account and that is the one thing about
 * the app worth knowing before you tap anything. What changed is where it goes:
 * it used to flip the role in place, which meant a mis-tap silently changed what
 * the app could do and left Settings with no way in at all. Now it opens
 * Settings, and the role is the card at the top of that screen with a sheet that
 * says what switching changes before it changes anything.
 *
 * A phone whose role may not see payments (a doctor's) has no Money tab: the
 * server refuses everything on it, so a tab of refusals is all it could be.
 *
 * `settings.html` labels this tab "Settings" over a gear. Naming the role is a
 * deliberate departure: the gear is the same on both phones, and which phone
 * this is answers more questions than what the screen contains.
