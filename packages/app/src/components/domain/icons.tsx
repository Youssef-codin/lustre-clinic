/**
 * The app's one icon set: every `lucide-react-native` glyph is picked here,
 * once per concept, and lint refuses the library anywhere else. The clusters'
 * `icons.tsx` files still name icons after the job they do on their screens and
 * set their own sizes and weights, but they build them from `GLYPH`, so "add"
 * is the same plus and "procedure" the same stethoscope on every screen.
 *
 * `ui/` cannot import this — it knows nothing of the library — so a primitive
 * that shows an icon takes it as a prop.
