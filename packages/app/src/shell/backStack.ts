// Where the hardware back goes. There is no navigator (SPEC §18 F3), so there
// is no stack to pop: each cluster holds its own route in state and the four of
// them stay mounted side by side. That leaves two questions this file answers,
// both as data so `bun test` can reach them — a renderer cannot.
//
// **Which handler.** One stack per tab, because only the tab that is up may
// answer. The three behind it are mounted and may well be holding a pushed
// screen, and popping one nobody is looking at is a back press that appears to
// do nothing.
//
// **What order.** Handlers are asked newest-first and the first to claim the
// press wins, so a screen pushed over another answers before it. The order is
// registration order, which is mount order, which is the order the user opened
// them in — and that only holds because a handler registers when its component
// mounts and stays registered, deciding for itself whether it has anything to
// pop. A handler that registered and unregistered as its screen opened and
// closed would be ordered by React's effect timing instead, and effects run
// children-first: a screen and the pane pushed over it arriving in the same
// commit would register inside-out, and back would pop the wrong one.
//
// So: register once, return `false` when there is nothing to pop, and let the
// press fall through.
