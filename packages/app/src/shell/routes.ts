// The two things the shell has to do that no cluster can do for itself, kept
// here as data so they can be tested — `bun test` has no renderer, so anything
// that only exists inside a component is verified on a device.
//
// **Pushing a route another cluster owns.** The record screen's Book, Walk-in
// and Record payment all land in the day or money cluster, and a cluster holds
// its own stack, so the ask has to go up to the shell and back down. It travels
// as a *request*, not a route: the destination decides which of its screens
// that means. `seq` is what makes one ask distinguishable from the next, so the
// same destination can be asked for twice — the pattern `PatientsCluster`
// already reads its record request with.
//
// **Going home.** Tapping the tab you are already on pops that cluster back to
// its root. The shell cannot pop a cluster from outside — it does not own the
// routes inside one — so it bumps a counter per tab and each cluster resets
// itself when its number changes, deciding for itself what home means.
//
// **Disconnected.** Which of the shell's two routes the connection state means.
