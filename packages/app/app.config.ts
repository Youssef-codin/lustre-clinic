/**
 * `app.json` is the config. This adds the one part that depends on who the
 * release is built for: the clinic server a release APK asks for OTA updates
 * (§15, infra/README.md "Releases").
 *
 * `LUSTRE_UPDATES_URL` is that server's tailnet address. It is baked into the
 * APK because expo-updates reads it before any JavaScript runs, so it cannot
 * come from setup the way the API address does. Without it, and on a demo build
 * whatever it says, updates are off and the APK runs only its own bundle: a demo
 * that took a production update would turn into the clinic's app. Debug builds
 * load Metro and never ask.
 *
 * Launch never waits on the network (`fallbackToCacheTimeout: 0`): the app
 * starts on what it already has, and an update downloads in the background and
 * runs on the next cold start. A reload mid-screen would cost the secretary a
 * half-filled booking, and a clinic in a power cut would sit on the splash
 * screen.
 *
 * Manifests are signed at publish time with a key kept out of the repo and off
 * the server. `certs/certificate.pem` is its public half, and the phone refuses
 * an update that does not verify against it.
 *
 * `LUSTRE_VERSION` is the release's number, which `scripts/release.ts` works
 * out and passes in (infra/README.md "Versions"). It is never written into
 * app.json: a number bumped by hand is a number somebody forgets. Anything
 * built without it is `0.0.0`, which is how a dev build reads.

 * It is baked into every build and read by none but a dev one (`api/config.ts`):
 * `__DEV__` is false in a release bundle whatever this says, so the value rides
 * along in a clinic's APK as a string nothing looks at.
 *
 * It is hashed into the runtime fingerprint the way `LUSTRE_UPDATES_URL` and
 * `LUSTRE_GLITCHTIP_DSN` are, so a release is built without it set — which is
 * what `bun release:apk` does, since only the three device scripts export it.
